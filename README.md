# Graal Native And Data Frames

This repository is a simple example of how to build a graal native application that
processes a CSV and both reads and writes to parquet.  With graal native you
lose some level of performance but you get a single packaged executable
with very few dependencies and of course instant startup time.


## Building

```console
scripts/compile
```


## Running

```console
./ds-graal
```
